## 🌄 About the Project

**Triund Trek** is a static website built to showcase moments from a Himalayan trek.  
Each section represents a different part of the journey — the climb, the people, the views, the sunset, the night, and the summit.

The goal was to create a calm, immersive experience where images and videos speak more than text.
